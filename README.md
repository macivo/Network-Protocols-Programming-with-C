This is a skeleton for your networking project work in BTI 3021.

It includes a code template with a build system.

Run "make" to build the assignment PDFs and your code.

Commit your code via "git push" for submission. You may submit as
often as you wish, we will grade the version submitted just before the
deadline.

You must edit the provided main C files to implement the project, or
modify the Makefile to create equivalent (!) programs for code written
in other languages.

Read nprj1.pdf, nprj2.pdf and nprj3.pdf for basic instructions for
each sprint.  If you have any questions about the objective, talk to
the professor assigned to you as project owner. If you have technical
questions about how to do something, feel free to talk to any of the
faculty members.

Read faq.pdf for frequently asked questions about the project!
